### DSGA 2271: Probabilistic Time Series Analysis

This repository contains notebooks that are worked out as part of lab sessions at NYU.

#### Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for DSGA 2271: Probabilistic Time Series Analysis, a graduate-level course at New York University. It contains curated Jupyter notebooks and supporting materials developed during weekly lab sessions, designed to reinforce core concepts and provide practical implementations of time series methodologies.

#### Contents

The notebooks cover fundamental and advanced topics including:
- Stochastic processes and probabilistic modeling
- Autoregressive and moving average models
- State-space representations and Kalman filtering
- Bayesian inference for time series
- Gaussian processes and kernel methods
- Variational inference and approximate posteriors

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

#### Usage
